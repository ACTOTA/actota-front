## Using Prisma

`npx prisma` is the CLI tool for Prisma. It is used to perform various tasks such as generating Prisma Client, running migrations, and more.

`npx prisma db push` is used to create a new database schema based on your Prisma schema file. It creates tables, columns, indexes, and foreign keys in the database.
